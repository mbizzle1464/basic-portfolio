            <img src="assets/images/Profile.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Michael Bizzle">

            <p>I am the Loyalty Retention Manager at Studio Movie Grill Home Office. I am responsible for mass communication
                to our guests through email and mobile sends. Our goal is to optimize our send practices with data driven
                segmented campaigns. I am also in charge of managing our Guest Services Department. I implemented the CRM
                ticketing system (Zendesk) for resolving guest related issues.</p>
            <p>I started coding when I was promoted to the current role I am in now. I started working with html emails and
                became intimate with understaing the art of html/css. I absolutely love working with code and decided to
                commit myself to this craft. I am currently placed in SMU's Full Stack Web Development Part-time course to
                take myself to the next level.
