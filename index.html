            <p>I am the Loyalty Retention Manager at Studio Movie Grill Home Office. I am responsible for mass communication to our guests
                through email and mobile sends.  Our goal is to optimize our send practices with data driven segmented campaigns.  I am also in charge 
                of managing our Guest Services Department. I implemented the CRM ticketing system (Zendesk) for resolving guest related issues.</p>
            <p>I started coding when I was promoted to the current role I am in now.  I started working with html emails and became intimate with
                understaing the art of html/css.  I absolutely love working with code and decided to commit myself to this craft.  I am currently 
                placed in SMU's Full Stack Web Development Part-time course to take myself to the next level.
